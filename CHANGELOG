Changelog:

 3.2.2 : Fix: Dualdownloaders broker since 3.2. NO CLUE why cause
              I havent touched that part, but its ok now anyway.
              Thanks DevilR for finding this one as well.

 Upgrading from 3.2.1: Replace ktmf.sh

----------------------------------------------------------------

 3.2.1 : Fix: If FOLDEEX was not defined, group excludes didnt
              work. With that note, this script needs a rewrite =)
              Thanks DevilR for finding it.

 Upgrading from 3.2: Replace ktmf.sh

----------------------------------------------------------------

 3.2   : Add: If you use LOCKFILE it will be automatically
              removed once it is 60 minutes old. That way the
              script will fix itself if the lockfile is left 
              behind because of a reboot.

----------------------------------------------------------------

 3.1.6 : Fix: When checking if it should ban slow uploaders
              (BANUL=TRUE/FALSE), it actually checked the BAN
              option which is the same thing but for slow 
              downloaders.

              Thanks fnx

              You can fix this yourself if you want. Go to line
              2017 of v3.1.5 and change the $BAN to $BANUL

 Upgrading from 3.1.5: Replace ktmf.sh

 Note: This script is getting old and well tested. I hardly know
 myself what some parts actually do cause I havent touched it
 in a long time. So, it will most likely not get the improvements
 some of you asked for. Sorry folks, but I feel this to be a 
 pretty complete script as is =(
          
----------------------------------------------------------------

 3.1.5 : Fix: It had problems dealing with -NEW- connections before
              the user logged in. It would, of course, give a grep
              error.
              It will now define -NEW- users as NotLoggedIn. Idle
              kicker will kick those connections too now. Any 
              punishment for idling will not be enforced due to
              the fact that we have no clue who this is yet. So it
              will simple kick them.
              Thanks to nm0 for reporting this !

 Upgrading from 3.1.4: Replace ktmf.sh

----------------------------------------------------------------

 3.1.4 : Fix: Slow download kicks announces a crippled warning instead of
              the "kicked" line.
              It sent KTMFSLDW instead of KTMFSLD when sending it to
              glftpd.log on line 1740.
              Thanks Peza for reporting it a long time ago and corzel to
              tell be what the problem was ( It was too easy, so I never
              found it myself =))

 Upgrading from 3.1.3: Replace ktmf.sh

----------------------------------------------------------------

 3.1.3 : Fix: Finally had the error myself from GENKICK so:
              Fixed it where GENKICK would kick people not having
              leech or wasnt in any of the kickgroups. Bloody 
              annoying error that has been eluding me.

 Upgrading from 3.1.2: Replace ktmf.sh.

 3.1.2 : Fix: Some people had problems with the generic kicker.
              Apparently kicked users without leech and users that
              were uploading. I rewrote some parts of it, but not
              sure if it helped since I never encountered it myself.
         Fix: Minor: Said SLOWUL: instead of GENKICK: at one place
              in the log. Its the cut and paste monster, ahhh !!
 
 Upgrading from 3.1.1: Only changes in ktmf.sh, so use old config.

 3.1.1 : Fix: Some had problems with kicks even though users
              were in their predirs. Worked fine for me, but
              added another check to be sure.

 Upgrading from 3.1 : Only changes in ktmf.sh, so use old config.

 3.1   : Add: Moved the configuration to ktmf.conf 
         Add: Some peoples zipscripts did not clear
              incomplete files when kicking from Slow Upload  
              and Dual Upload modules, leaving a half empty   
              file there.                                     
              KTMF will now check if the file(s) the user was 
              uploading exists, and if so, delete them and    
              undupe them.                                    
              Setting UNDUPE to "" will disable undupe, and   
              KTMF will only try and remove the files.

              NOTE: Some people have problems with the undupe file
                    that came pre-compiled for linux with glftpd 1.27.
                    Try running it from shell. If you do NOT get the 
                    "USEAGE:" (yes it really says that, lol) help, then
                    compile it from the source that came with the glftpd
                    package, and replace your current undupe file.


              New settings in the config, since last version, will 
              from now on be marked with a <--    
 
 Upgrading from 3.0 : Copy the settings to a file called ktmf.conf
                      Replace ktmf.sh
                      Add to the settings at the top of your existing 
                      config file:
                      GLROOT=/glftpd                                  
                      UNDUPE=/glftpd/bin/undupe                       
                      UNDUPEUSER=glftpd                               
                      -- Make sure the user have flag C for undupe.      
                                                              
 3.0.1 : Fix: If you did not have any users excluded, only    
              groups, it would start the exclude list with a  
              | sign, thus excluding everyone.                
              Thanks to Web for finding it, although I still  
              think its a Slackware problem !! =)             
         Upd: No config changes this time (Upd = Updating).   

 3.0   : Add: Rewrote how it checks for excluded users by     
              groups, making it about 800% faster at that.    
              This makes GEXCLUDEON obselete, but I'll keep   
              in anyway for backwards compability.            
              Plus it saves about 1 second if you want it off 
      -> Add: Changed all the bot outputs to comply with the  
              generic way of doing them. I have included docs 
              for how to get them to work with Dark0n3s       
              zipscript-c. This also means that it is much    
              easier for you if you wish to change the output 
              text. If you are upgrading, make sure to read   
              the README on how it works now.                 
              BOTTRIGGER option removed as it has no purpose  
              anymore.                                        
      -> Add: Added a new module. General Kick. See README.   
      -> Add: Added a new module. Slow upload. See README.    
         Add: Remade how it restores tempban. Instead of      
              making a backup of the unedited userfile, I now 
              simply add a 6 to the flags when tempbanning    
              and removing any 6 when restoring tempban.      
              This means that a user can be logged on twice,  
              and only the pid that was breaking the rule     
              is kicked instead of both of them. Of course,   
              should he log out with the logged in process,   
              he cant log back in until the tempban is gone.  
              This also means that the Fix in 2.1.2 is no     
              longer needed and has been removed.             
         Add: Added more debug output if you use PREEXCLUDE.  
      -> Fix: Groups, like users, should now be seperated     
              with a | instead of a space. Check your setup.  

 2.1.2 : Fix: If a user is in a prefolder, and at the same    
              time idling or slow downloading somewhere else, 
              he/she will be excluded from idling and slowdl. 
              In short. The first module that finds him in a  
              prefolder will exclude him from the rest of the 
              modules.                                        
              Update, this was removed in version 3.0         

 2.1.1 : Fix: Something weird happened so it didnt kick slow  
              downloaders. Not sure what it was but I think   
              I fixed it.                                     

 2.1   : Add: For those of you who feel that the PREFOLDERS   
              setting is not secure enough, I added           
              PREEXCLUDE. Add all your pre folders here and   
              the script will automatically exclude all       
              groups found in those folders, like in my trial 
              scripts.                                        
              This makes PREFOLDERS kinda worthless, but I    
              like to punish my affils when they are NOT in   
              their pre folders, so I'll keep it anyway.      

 2.0.1 : Fix: DualUp. Would say the wrong path they were dual 
              upping in sometimes.                            
       : Fix: If DEBUG was not true, it waited DELAYDUALUP    
              seconds even if there were no dual uploaders.   

 2.0   : Add: Added the dual upload module. See README.       
         Add: Added LOG. Some people apparently wanted it so  
              here it is. It will log all kicks and whatever  
              it does to its own logfile. Disable totally by  
              setting LOG=""                                  
         Add: Added a verification check before kicking or    
              announcing. This should eliminate any misfires  
              you might have seen in the past.                
         Add: Some more initial info when running DEBUG mode. 
         Add: If you run this with 'ktmf.sh test', it will    
              set DEBUG, TEST and SHOWEXCLUDES to TRUE, no    
              matter what they are set to in the script. Good 
              if you want to test it from shell, but are too  
              lazy to change them to TRUE in the script.      
         Fix: Sometimes it counted the number of users wrong, 
              resulting in kicks or whatever when there were  
              less users on site then specified.              
              It could also cause weird results, such as      
              trying to kick parts of a filename or command.  

 1.2   : Fix: Exclude error again. Should be the last one.    
         Add: Ability to exclude users who are in pre dirs.   
              This requires the new tur-ftpwho to work!       

 1.1.1 : Fix: Minor error. If debug was FALSE, it waited for  
              DELAYDUALDL even if it did not find anyone dual 
              downloading.                                    
         Add: Added possibility to set KILLGHOST="" to        
              disable the function totally.                   
         Add: If DEBUG and SHOWEXCLUDES are TRUE, it will     
              make a nicer output of excluded users.          

 1.1   : Add: LIMITTODUALKICK. You can now set a usercount    
              that must be on the site before it starts to    
              kick for dual downloading, like for the others. 
         Add: Added BANDUAL to Dual Downloading so you can    
              give users a tempban there too. Of course,      
              DUALBANTIME comes with that one too.            
         Fix: If Temp banning is enabled on any of the        
              functions, it will find ALL pids of a user and  
              kick them all. Why?:                            
              Say that hes slowdownloading and are uploading  
              in another thread.                              
              Before, if he was tempbanned, he could still    
              upload on the other thread. Then when he was    
              unbanned, everything he did in that time would  
              be lost. Now the uploading thread will be       
              kicked too, but only if tempbanning is enabled. 
         Fix: Added some more checks to make sure it will run 
         Fix: Fixed spelling errors in outputs and in README. 
                                                              
 1.0.5 : Fix: If /glftpd/bin was not in the path, it did not  
         find tur-ftpwho. Fixed by adding WHOBIN.             

 1.0.4 : Fix: Even more exclude merge problems fixed. hehe.   

 1.0.3 : Fix: Display bug if FOLDEREX was "".                 
         Fix: More exclude merging problems fixes.            

 1.0.2 : Fix: Bug with userexcludes if GEXCLUDEON was FALSE.  
         Does not cause locking if it cant find any folder.   

 1.0.1 : Just added FOLDEREX.                                 

 1.0   : Initial release. What you see is what you get.
